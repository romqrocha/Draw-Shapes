# Draw-Shapes
This program reads coordinates from an input file, creates a shape by drawing lines, and then fills the area inside the shape.
All drawing is done with ASCII asterisks (*).

Use: ./DrawShapes.out \<input> \<output>
 * input - Path of text file to be taken as input
 * output - Path of text file where output will be written

Refer to ExampleInput.txt for an example of how the input file should be formatted.
